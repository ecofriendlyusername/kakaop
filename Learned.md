## Compiled vs Interpreted
### compiled languages
- Assembler, COBOL, PL/I, C/C++
- translated by running the source code through a compiler
- very efficient code that can be executed any number of times
- overhead for the translation incurred just once (when the source is compiled; thereafter, it need only be loaded and executed.)

### interpreted language
- must be parsed, interpreted, and executed each time the program is run
- usually less efficient than compiled programs 
- speed of development faster?
- interpreter assigns a type to all the variables at run-time(type decided based on value)

Java™, can be either interpreted or compiled.

파이썬은 자바랑 달리 함수를 쓰는 코드가 위에 있는게 문제가 되길래 찾아보았다.
